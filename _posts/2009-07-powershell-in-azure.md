The <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=aa40f3e2-afc5-484d-b4e9-6a5227e73590&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank">July CTP release of the Windows Azure SDK</a> contains a new sample project called PowerShellRole which demonstrates that PowerShell is available in the cloud!



Previous versions of the CTP have come with a sample Provider which you could use to access Azure storage (blobs, queues, and tables), but this actually provides demonstration of creating runspaces and executing pipelines in the cloud.



Now to see what version is running in the cloud!

At the Chef meetup in Seattle on Tuesday night, Adam Edwards (our dev lead on our Windows efforts) made the [DSC cookbook available](https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/dsc). &nbsp;


This is a preview of functionality that will make its way into our core platform, but it highlights the direction we are taking to integrate DSC features.


I'll be experimenting with this myself in the very near future, but feel free to clone the cookbook and start playing around and hammering me with your questions.


## UPDATED:&nbsp;

<p dir="ltr">Now with the video of the meetup, including Adam's presentation and a guest appearance by Jeffrey Snover!

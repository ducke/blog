I'm back on the mic with a new podcast, <a href="http://www.opsallthethings.com/" target="_blank">Ops All The Things</a>&nbsp;with Christopher Webber (<a href="http://twitter.com/cwebber" target="_blank">twitter</a>/<a href="http://t.co/53p4rQ1W" target="_blank">blog</a>) on Systems Administration, Operations, and all sorts of other stuff.&nbsp;


We've got our first episode introducing the show up and are planning for two shows a month. &nbsp;Check it out and let me know what you want to hear about.

This year at <a href="http://www.msteched.com/teched/default.aspx?WT.srch=1&amp;mode=1&amp;CR_ID=-1&amp;CR_TC=9MIUMGEXBBD0NBD" target="_blank">TechEd (North America)</a>, <a href="http://halr9000.com/" target="_blank">Hal Rottenberg</a> and I will be there promoting PowerShell and <a href="http://powershellcommunity.org" target="_blank">PowerShellCommunity.Org</a>.  We will be bouncing around various sessions, the PowerShell booth, and the remaining conference.
If you have a PowerShell story that you want to share, find me (I'm a big guy and easy to pick out of a crowd).  I'll have some recording gear and be looking to collect some user stories.



See you there!

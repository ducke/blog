I had the honor of being asked back to the [Fundamentals ](/s/Fundamentals.zip)and [Toolkit ](/s/Toolkit.zip)classes, including shell history from the Fundamentals class.


If you are interested taking these classes, I'll be giving them at the upcoming <a href="http://lopsa-east.org/2013/" target="_blank">LOPSA-East conference</a>.

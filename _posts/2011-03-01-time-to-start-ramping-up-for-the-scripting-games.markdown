The <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/heyscriptingguy/archive/2011/02/19/2011-scripting-games-all-links-on-one-page.aspx" target="_blank">2011 Scripting Games</a> are fast approaching (April 4th through the 15th)..



If youâ€™ve been holding off on learning a bit a PowerShell, now is the time to step up and try some of these events.&#160; <a href="http://twitter.com/scriptingguys" target="_blank">Ed Wilson</a> put together <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/heyscriptingguy/archive/2011/02/11/2011-scripting-games-study-guide.aspx" target="_blank">a study guide</a> to help prepare you for some of the skills and techniques you will exercise.



If you have participated before, this year promises to be as fun and exciting, if not more so.



See you at the Games!
